# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 15 - GSM reconstruction for Bacillus subtilis producing riboflavin

## Project summary 
iYO844(GSM) is a module to prove cell factory strategy. Bacillus subtilis is a cell factory to produce riboflavin. This module has high consistency scores and metabolic coverage, which means it can better simulate cell factories. Two plans were used to increase the yield of riboflavin. The first one is to knock out two different genes. The second one is to knock out one gene and over-express another one. However, both of them cannot increase the yield.

## Project overview
In file GSM General.ipynb, it expresses the information of module iYO844 and inserts this module to simulate.

In file Carbon Source and Oxygen Optimization.ipynb, we show the max yield of product and biomass in different situations (e.g., Anaerobic and Aerobic)

In file Gene Knockout Strategies.ipynb, you can find our strategies to increase the yield of products. After simulation, The model predictions are not expected to be completely accurate. 

All of the pictures used in the report are in pics file.
