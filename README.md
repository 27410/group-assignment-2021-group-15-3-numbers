# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 15 - GSM reconstruction for Bacillus subtilis producing riboflavin

## Project summary 
iYO844(GSM) is a module to prove cell factory strategy. Bacillus subtilis is a cell factory to produce riboflavin. This module has high consistency scores and metabolic coverage, which means it can better simulate cell factories. Two plans were used to increase the yield of riboflavin. The first one is to knock out two different genes. The second one is to knock out one gene and over-express another one. However, both of them cannot increase the yield.
